# Shopping Cart
The Online Shopping Cart System is designed to provide a practical demonstration of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles using Java. This application simulates an online shopping experience where users can browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. The system is built to highlight core OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
